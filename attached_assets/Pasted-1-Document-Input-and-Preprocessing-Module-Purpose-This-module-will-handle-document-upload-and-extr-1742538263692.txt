1. Document Input and Preprocessing Module
Purpose: This module will handle document upload and extraction of text from different formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.).
Python Tools:
File Handling: For uploading and reading files.
PDF Text Extraction: Use PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, or PyMuPDF to extract text from PDFs.
DOCX Text Extraction: Use python-docx for extracting text from DOCX files.
Text Cleaning: Use regular expressions (re) or string manipulation to clean unwanted characters from the extracted text.
Functions:

Extract text from PDF
Extract text from DOCX
Clean and format the extracted text
2. Text Summarization Module
Purpose: This module will handle the text summarization using an API or AI model (like GPT-3, etc.).
Python Tools:
OpenAI API: Use openai library to integrate GPT-3 or GPT-4 for summarization.
Hugging Face API: Alternatively, you can use the transformers library to work with models like BART or T5 for summarization if you prefer open-source.
Functions:

Send extracted text to the summarization model (e.g., OpenAI GPT-3) and receive the summary.
Configure model parameters like max tokens or summarization length.
3. Clause and Key Point Extraction Module
Purpose: This module will identify important clauses and terms in the contract, like "Agreement Terms", "Parties Involved", etc.
Python Tools:
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Use spaCy, nltk, or transformers for processing and extracting specific information from the text.
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Use spaCy's NER capabilities to detect entities like company names, dates, and legal terms.
Keyword Extraction: Use RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction), TF-IDF, or spaCy to extract relevant keywords or legal terms.
Functions:

Extract legal terms like dates, parties, and obligations.
Identify sections and clauses based on predefined headings or patterns.
Return identified clauses and terms for display.
4. Result Formatting and Presentation Module
Purpose: Format and present the summarized content and extracted clauses in a readable format for the user.
Python Tools:
Formatting: Use Python string formatting for output or json for structured data output.
Web Framework (Optional): If you decide to build a web interface, use a Python web framework like Flask or Django to present results.
Functions:

Format summary and extracted clauses into JSON, HTML, or plain text for easy reading.
Organize results under different sections such as Summary, Key Clauses, Keywords.
5. User Interface Module (Optional)
Purpose: If you need a front-end (web or CLI), this module will provide the interface for users to upload documents and view results.
Python Tools:
Web Framework (for Web UI): Use Flask or Django for a web interface.
CLI (for command-line interface): Use argparse or click for a command-line interface.
Functions:

Allow users to upload files (via HTTP requests for web or file input for CLI).
Display the summarized contract and extracted clauses to the user in a clean format.
High-Level Python Flow:
User Uploads Document:

Web: The user uploads a contract through a web form (Flask or Django).
CLI: The user specifies the file path via the command line.
Text Extraction:

The document is processed, and text is extracted using PyPDF2, python-docx, or another library depending on the file format.
Text Summarization:

The extracted text is sent to an AI model or API for summarization, such as OpenAI's GPT-3 or Hugging Face transformers.
Clause and Key Point Extraction:

After summarization, the text is processed to extract key clauses and important terms using NLP techniques with spaCy, nltk, or transformers.
Result Formatting and Presentation:

The results (summary and clauses) are formatted into a readable structure, which could be displayed on a web page (if you are building a web app) or printed in the console (if itâ€™s a CLI tool).
Suggested Python Libraries/Tools:
Text Extraction: PyPDF2, pdfminer.six, python-docx
Summarization: openai (for GPT-3), transformers (for Hugging Face models like T5, BART)
NLP & Clause Extraction: spaCy, nltk, RAKE, TF-IDF
Web Framework: Flask or Django (if building a web interface)
Formatting and Output: json, html, string formatting
